\begin{prob}
    Recall that the Bellman-Ford algorithm (with early stopping) will terminate early
    if, after updating every edge, no predecessors have changed. Suppose it is
    known that the greatest shortest path distance in a graph $G = (V, E)$ has
    $\Theta(\sqrt{V})$ edges. What is the worst case time complexity of
    Bellman-Ford when run on this graph? State your answer using $\Theta$
    notation.
