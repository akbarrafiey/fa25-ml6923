\begin{prob}
    Suppose $G = (V, E, \omega)$ is a weighted graph without negative cycles. 
        Suppose we have an edge $(u, v) \in E$ whose weight is $w(u, v) = 5$. 
        Let $s\in V$ be the source node. Let $\delta(s, u)$ and $\delta(s, v)$ denote the shortest path distance from $s$ to $u$ and to $v$, respectively. 
        
        
    \begin{subprobset}

       (True or False):  Now suppose that $G$ is a {\bf directed} graph. 
        Then, it is possible that $\delta(s, u) = 50$ but $\delta(s, v) = 10$.

                Then, it is possible that  $\delta(s, u) = 50$ but $\delta(s, v) = 10$.
