\begin{prob}
    True or False. Suppose $G = (V, E, \omega)$ is a weighted graph for which
    all edges are positive, except for those edges of a node $s$ which may or
    may not be negative. If Dijkstra's algorithm is run on $G$ with $s$ as
    the source, the correct shortest paths will be found. Assume that the graph does not have any negative loops. Justify your answer.
